<h2><ins>Here's what i learnt</ins></h2>
<h4> I used useMemo react hook to:</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Change the theme of my website. I stored the mode as the dependency and a function <br>
that changes the theme only if the mode in the dependency array has changed. <br>
 - I stored the mode inside Redux as a state and is only changed after the user clicks the theme icon inside the Navbar </li>
<li>To change the graph of total units and total sales. <br>
 - I used useMemo to memoize the creation of the two line objects for the chart based on the data passed as a prop,<br>
so that the objects are only created when the data changes, and not on every re-render of the component that uses this code.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>On the backend</h4>
 - I learnt how to use aggregate to join two tables in mongoDB, which is more faster. <br>
 - I did it at /server/controllers/management.js as i get the users perfomance i combined the <b>user</b> and <b>transaction</b> .
Than doing it manually as i did at /server/controllers/client.js to get the products by getting all the products froom the Product <br>
table and iterated through each product to get the id and matched it with productId from the productStat table and then returning the product and the stats. <br>
 - I also learn't how to use Material UI on my frontend and how its prolific when making a table data grid than building your own from scratch
